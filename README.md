# Dog vs. Cat Classification using CNN  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **Dog vs. Cat Classification Model** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The model is trained to distinguish between images of cats and dogs with high accuracy. This is a fundamental deep learning task widely used in computer vision applications.  

## ✨ Features  
- 🐶🐱 **Classifies images as either a dog or a cat.**  
- 🤖 **Utilizes CNNs for feature extraction and classification.**  
- 📊 **Evaluates performance using accuracy and loss metrics.**  
- 🔄 **Applies data augmentation for better generalization.**  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of labeled images of:  
- **Dogs** 🐶  
- **Cats** 🐱  

Each image is:  
- **Resized** to `224x224` pixels.  
- **Normalized** for consistent pixel values.  
- **Augmented** to improve model performance.  

## 🛠 Requirements  
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:  
```bash  
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python scikit-learn  
```  

## 🏗 Model Architecture  
- **CNN-based Model:** Uses multiple convolutional layers followed by dense layers.  
- **Activation Function:** Softmax for binary classification.  
- **Loss Function:** Binary Cross-Entropy.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training Process  
1. 📥 **Load & preprocess the dataset.**  
2. 🔄 **Apply data augmentation techniques.**  
3. 🏗 **Build and train the CNN model.**  
4. 🎯 **Evaluate the model using validation data.**  
5. 📊 **Visualize training accuracy & loss.**  

## 📊 Project Insights & Results  
### 🔍 Insights:  
- The dataset was **balanced**, containing an equal number of dog and cat images, ensuring fair training.  
- **Data augmentation** (rotation, flipping, zoom) significantly improved generalization and reduced overfitting.  
- The CNN model successfully extracted unique features, differentiating between dogs and cats effectively.  

### 📈 Results:  
- **Training Accuracy:** ~98%  
- **Validation Accuracy:** ~95%  
- **Loss Reduction:** The model showed steady convergence with minimal overfitting.  
- **Misclassifications:** Some challenges occurred with ambiguous images where features were less distinct.  

## 🚀 Usage  
To run the model, execute the Jupyter Notebook:  
```bash  
jupyter notebook Dog_vs_Cat_Classification.ipynb  
```  

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
