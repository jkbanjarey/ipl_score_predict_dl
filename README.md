# 🏏 IPL Score Prediction using Deep Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on predicting the final **IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket match scores** using **Deep Learning models**. By analyzing match data such as team performance, overs, wickets, and other statistical features, the model predicts the final score based on real-time inputs.  

## ✨ Features  
- 📊 **Predicts IPL match scores based on historical data.**  
- ⚡ **Utilizes deep learning models for accurate score forecasting.**  
- 📉 **Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive key insights.**  
- 🔄 **Implements data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques.**  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains IPL match statistics, including:  
- 🏏 **Batting and bowling team names**  
- 🔢 **Current score, overs, and wickets**  
- ⏳ **Run rate and last few overs' performance**  
- 🏟 **Match venue and playing conditions**  

## 🛠 Requirements  
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:  
```bash  
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow scikit-learn  
```  

## 🏗 Model Architecture  
- **Neural Network-based Regression Model:** Uses dense layers to predict the final match score.  
- **Activation Function:** ReLU for hidden layers, Linear for output.  
- **Loss Function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE).  
- **Optimizer:** Adam optimizer for efficient training.  

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training Process  
1. 📥 **Load & preprocess the dataset.**  
2. 📊 **Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).**  
3. 🏗 **Build and train the deep learning model.**  
4. 🎯 **Evaluate the model on test data.**  
5. 📈 **Visualize predictions vs actual scores.**  

## 📊 Project Insights & Results  
### 🔍 Insights:  
- **Feature Importance:** Overs played, wickets lost, and run rate significantly influence score prediction.  
- **Data Trends:** Certain teams tend to perform better at specific venues.  
- **Model Performance:** Neural networks outperformed traditional regression models in prediction accuracy.  

### 📈 Results:  
- **Training Accuracy (R² Score):** ~95%  
- **Validation Accuracy (R² Score):** ~92%  
- **Error Reduction:** The model successfully minimizes prediction errors using deep learning techniques.  

## 🚀 Usage  
To run the model, execute the Jupyter Notebook:  
```bash  
jupyter notebook ipl_score_predict_dl.ipynb  
```  

## 🔮 Future Enhancements  
- 📡 **Integrate live match data for real-time predictions.**  
- 🎯 **Use advanced models like LSTM and XGBoost for better accuracy.**  
- 🏟 **Analyze the impact of pitch conditions and weather.**
